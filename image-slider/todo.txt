Code cleanup improvements

- Removed magic numebers 
- better performance with event delegation for dots, which prevents DOM re-querying which basically means that instead each dot have a listener, each dot element inside the dots-container referes to the function that handles dot clicks.
- Fixed accessibility for dots
- Implemented error handling, (not really important for this small project but still a good practice)
- Fixed the structure of the code (initialization, event handlers and the slider functions)
- Created a reusable functionf for the timer
